# NHTSA-api-project

NHTSA has lots of unrated cars in their database, so here I list few working (not empty or poorly rated) examples:
1. 2023 Acura MDX Suv AWD
2. 2023 Honda ODYSSEY MV FWD
3. 2021 Audi A4 4 DR AWD
4. 2010 Kia Sportage 4-DR w/SAB
5. 2018 Lincoln Continental 4 DR AWD
6. 2017 Chrysler 300 4 DR AWD

If you want to check your own examples I recommend checking american car brands, because european ones are mostly "Not rated".

What I have mainly learned while doing this project is how to work with APIs and images in python and also how to use TKinter module.
